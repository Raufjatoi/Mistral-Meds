## Problem
Many people find it difficult to find medicines that they need. or there are other restraints like one medicine not available in their area. so they have to search for alternatives. ask doctors and pharmacies for help. but it takes a lot of time and effort to find the right medicine. 

## Solution
Mistral meds help user to find the medicine alternative with same formula and even if the user dont know the name of the medicine, they can search for it by symptoms. or ask i have the head ach which medicine i should take. and like that and then the ai suggest the couple of meds with same formula so the user can buy cause for small syptoms user dont have to go to the doctor and waste time and money.
